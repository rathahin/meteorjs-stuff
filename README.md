Ground DB
=========
GroundDB is a fast and thin layer providing Meteor offline database and methods - Taking cloud data to the ground.

```js
  // Return a grounded Meteor.Collection
  var list = new GroundDB('list');
```

##Meteor Collection Interface
GroundDB is like a normal `Meteor.Collection` - but changes and outstanding methods are cached and resumed.

[Live basic debug test](http://grounddb.meteor.com/)

##Features:
* Ligth footprint
* Broad browser support Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer 9
* Fallback to normal Meteor.Collection if no localstorage
* Resume of changes in collections
* Resume of methods
* Works offline updating cross window tabs
* Support for [SmartCollection](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-smart-collections)
* Support for offline client-side only databases
* Uses `EJSON.minify` and `EJSON.maxify` to compress data in localstorage
*In the future there will be a customizable conflict handler on the server-side*

##Creating a GroundDB object (variants)
```js

  // Return a grounded Meteor.Collection
  var list = new GroundDB('list');

  or

  // Get the groundDB of existing Meteor.Collection
  var list = new Meteor.Collection('list');
  var groundList = new GroundDB(list);

  or

  // Ground an existing Meteor.Collection  
  var list = new Meteor.Collection('list');
  // just ground the database:
  GroundDB(list);
```
*Example of different patterns. Grounding a `Meteor.Collection` will attach the `cache`, `resume` and `cross tabs update offline`*

##Pure client-side offline databases (variants)
GroundDB can be applyed on client-side only eg.: `new Meteor.Collection(null);`
```js

  // Creates client-side only database, this one maps on suffix `null`
  var list = new GroundDB(null);

  // Creates client-side only database, this one maps on suffix `list`
  var list = new GroundDB(null, 'list');
  
  or

  // Get the groundDB of existing Meteor.Collection
  var list = new Meteor.Collection(null);
  var groundList = new GroundDB(list, 'list');

  or

  // Ground an existing Meteor.Collection  
  var list = new Meteor.Collection(null);
  // just ground the database and map on suffix `list`
  GroundDB(list, 'list');
```

##Support
Tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE9 *(though appcache is not supported in IE9 tabs are updated when offline)* - but all browsers that support localstorage *contains a FF safe test of localstorage*

If localstorage is not supported the groundDB simply work as a normal `Meteor.Collection`

##Concept
Localstorage is simple and widely supported - but slow - *Thats why we only use it for caching databases and methods + trying to limit the read and writes from it.*

GroundDB saves outstanding methods and minimongo db into localstorage - The number of saves to localstorage is minimized.

When the app loads GroundDB resumes methods and database changes - made when offline and browser closed.

##Ground user details
It's possible to mount an allready existing collection on a `groundDB` eg.:
```js
  GroundDB(Meteor.users);
```
*The example will keep `Meteor.user()` returning correct user details - even if offline*

##Ground SmartCollections
It's possible to ground an allready existing `smartCollectin` on a `groundDB` eg.:
```js
  var mySmartCollection = new SmartCollection('foo');
  GroundDB(mySmartCollection);

  // use the smart collection
  mySmartCollection.insert(/* stuff */);
```

##Resume of outstanding methods
Database changes and methods will be sent to the server just like normal. The methods are sent to server after relogin - this way `this.userId` isset when running on the server. In other words: `Just like normal`

##Publish and subscription
###Online
Subscription behavior when using `GroundDB` - When online it's just like normal `Meteor` so nothing new. If you unsubscribe a collection you can still insert etc. but the data will not be visible on the client.
###Offline
When offline the data remains in the local database - since the publish is a server thing. Use the query selector for filtering unwanted data.
*When reconnected the database will update client subscription and changes will be resumed*

##Events *- client-side*
The event api is as follows:
```js
GroundDB.onQuotaExceeded = function() {};
GroundDB.onResumeDatabase = function(name) {};
GroundDB.onResumeMethods = function() {};
GroundDB.onMethodCall = function(methodCall) {};
GroundDB.onCacheDatabase = function(name) {};
GroundDB.onCacheMethods = function() {};
GroundDB.onTabSync = function(key) {};

// Reactive status of all subscriptions, ready or not:
GroundDB.ready();
```

##Conflict handling *IN the works - not ready for use yet*
The conflict handling api is as follows:
```js
GroundDB.now(); // Returns server timestamp works on both client and server
```

##Future
* At the moment the conflict resolution is pretty basic last change recieved by server wins. This could be greatly improved by adding a proper conflict handler. *For more details look at comment in server.js*
* Intelligent subscriptions - A way for the groundDB to keep the data most important for the user - and letting less important data go to match quota limit
