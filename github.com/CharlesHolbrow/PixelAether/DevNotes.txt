Places Dependent on Chunk/Tile size in pixels:
ChunkRenderer - render and init methods
World - simToWorld and init

Goal:
Universal Method of getting pixel dimensions of chunk. 
I like Individual Chunks being able to figure out their own based on the tilesize
the problem is that if gGame.tileset CHANGES, this will not trigger an update... actually that's not really a problem --  we are rendering every frame anyway. No! not true -- only the position of chunks renders every frame. 

The current implementation will not trigger an update if we change the object that gGame.map points to for that, we would need to use something like gGame.setMap()
 
Solutions: 
  Search for and remove old references to gGame.tileset and gGame.map. remove from gGame
  Find and remove references to gGame.view.canvas.height and .width, replace with view.size.get()

Hacks to fix:
  fix Drag Input Method, so it checks for a distance.
