WhatWhen
========

WhatWhen is an app for freelancers to help with managing project timelines. 

It's built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and 100% free. Thought it may be helpful to share the source code for anyone looking to learn a bit more about the framework.

No promises on tidy code :) If you have questions about how/why I did something, shoot me an email: ryan@whatwhenapp.com.

You can check out and sign up for the app here: http://whatwhenapp.com. 

If you like this, I'd also suggest checking out Proper, another app I'm working on to manage freelance contracts: http://properapp.com.
