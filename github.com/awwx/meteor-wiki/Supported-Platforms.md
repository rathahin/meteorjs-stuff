If you don't see your platform on the list, consider contributing or filing issues for whatever needs to be done to support your operating system.

## Mac and Linux Officially Supported

Currently, Meteor is officially supported on the following platforms:
* Mac: OS X 10.6 and above
* Linux: x86 or x86_64 Debian- and Red Hat-based systems

## Other Linux

Although the installer will not run, running Meteor from a git checkout will usually work on non Debian- or Red Hat-based machines. See https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/README.md#slow-start-for-developers.

## State of Windows support

Official Windows support is coming. 

In the meantime, Windows users are encouraged to use the unofficial Windows installer for Meteor at http://win.meteor.com/.  Huge thanks to Tom Wijsman for his work on this.

Please contribute to bringing official Windows support to Meteor:
* Report Windows-related bugs at https://github.com/TomWij/meteor/issues.
* Test the unofficial Windows installer on various versions of Windows, and report back on how it goes.
* If you have experience with cross-platform development, we could particularly use your help:
    * Review the code at https://github.com/TomWij/meteor
    * Make incremental improvements and submit pull requests to TomWij's fork for review
    * Read [this thread](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/291) for some starter ideas about what you can help with
