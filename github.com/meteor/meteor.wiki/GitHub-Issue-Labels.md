This explains the various labels that we use in the issue tracker.

## unconfirmed-bug
Needs more information. Eg, a way to replicate, more details on observed behavior, etc.

## confirmed-bug
Known and confirmed behavior that should be changed.

## needs-docs
It's a known behavior that can be addressed through docs. Err on the side of this rather than "feature" whenever possible.

## pull-requests-encouraged
We agree that this behavior should be improved and we'd be happy to review pull requests to fix it, but fixing it ourselves isn't an immediate priority for any of our core developers. (Of course, we love pull requests for any issue, but there are some areas where the core team already has plans to fix it soon or rewrite the entire module; this label highlights places where an external pull request is the best way to get things fixed.)

## feature
Addressing it would require feature work on someone's part.

## `<feature-name>`, e.g. "spark"
It will likely be resolved when that feature is released. 

## wont-fix
An issue that we've decided not to fix.  This is a last resort: see if "needs-docs" works before using this label.
