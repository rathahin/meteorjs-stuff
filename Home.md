### <a name="bugs"></a>Filing Bug Reports

See our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md) for details on how to file a bug report.

By making it as easy as possible for others to reproduce your bug, you make it easier for your bug to be fixed. **We're not always able to tackle issues opened without a reproduction recipe. In those cases we'll close them with a pointer to the contributing guidelines and a request for more information.**

### How To Contribute

Contributing doesn't necessarily mean working on Meteor internals.  See the [Get Involved page on meteor.com](http://www.meteor.com/get-involved) for a starter list of ways to contribute. You might also want to check out the [Meteor Roadmap](http://roadmap.meteor.com).

To contribute code to Meteor core, submit a pull request.  Follow the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md), please!
